# Final Project CS50 - Password Generator
#### Demo video: https://youtu.be/Qr-XIMSht7c
#### Description:

## How to use:
My final project is a site that can generate passwords, it has four checkboxes where the user can show how he wants his password. The password can have symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters

## Technologies:
To make the site I used the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flask
- Javascript

## code:
### index.html:
In index.html you have all the HTML for the site. At the end of the body I also used jinja to display a message in case the user does not use the site correctly. It also has a JavaScript function for the user to copy the password with a button.

### style.css:
Here is the CSS for the page, at the bottom is the code to make the site responsive.

### main.py:
In main.py you have Flask. Here is the code to generate the password randomly and with the settings the user has chosen.
